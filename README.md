# Franxxmin
A multi-functional Discord Bot based on Javacord

[![Discord Bots](https://top.gg/api/widget/688561837020545080.svg)](https://top.gg/bot/688561837020545080)

Do not:
- Reuse functions and call them your own
- Use the whole code and start your own bot with it(doesn't matter if modified or not)

Known issues:
- Gifs sometimes don't get loaded into the embed (Server Issues, will definitely fix after moving to a new host)
- Gif loading is slow (see above)
