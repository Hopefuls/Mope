Renamed the Bot from Franxxmin to Mope

Do not:
- Reuse functions and call them your own
- Use the whole code and start your own bot with it(doesn't matter if modified or not)

Known issues:
- Gifs sometimes don't get loaded into the embed (Server Issues, will definitely fix after moving to a new host)
- Gif loading is slow (see above)
